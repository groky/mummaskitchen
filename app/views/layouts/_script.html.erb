<span class="blurb">Welcome to Mumma’s kitchen. My inspiration in doing this comes from my own Mother and my father’s mother; both whom I refer to as “MUMMA”. <br />These women are known to have kind, generous hearts, an amazing ability to entertain and OVER cater! Hence how I come into it, since I too am an habitual ‘Over Caterer'.<br /> The idea occurred during a thought I had thought one day; maybe I could “kill two birds with the one stone” and help out working families by plating up a reasonably priced home cooked meal whilst clearing my excess!! <br /><br />
So, welcome, hope you enjoy and would love some feedback on how I could do more to assist you ease your cooking burden during your busy day!</span>
